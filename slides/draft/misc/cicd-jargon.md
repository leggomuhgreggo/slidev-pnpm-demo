# Generic Vocabulary

- integration

- delivery

- deploy 

- release

# Release vs Deploy
Often intechangable

> **Deploy** - code on server

<br />

> **Release** - available to users


<br />

#### Sequencing?

**deploy ➡️ release** 🚩    👈👈👈

> "I am enabling the flag to release"

<br/>

> "I am going to cut a release"

# Rollout?
Can be used in reference to either "deploy" or "release"

## CI/CD

> Continuous Integration + Continuous Delivery

<br />

## Continuous Deployment

<br />

## Progressive Delivery 🔥

> Automated release w/ feature flags + observability
